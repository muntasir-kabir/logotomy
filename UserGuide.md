# logotomy — User Guide

*A high-performance log analyzer for when you open a giant log file and go "…logotomy happened here?"*

logotomy chews through 50MB+ text/log files without breaking a sweat, mines the
structure out of them automatically, and gives you an interactive timeline to
see exactly when things went sideways.

---

## 1. Installation & Running

### macOS

```bash
# Download the latest release .dmg (Apple Silicon: _aarch64, Intel: _x86_64),
# open it and drag logotomy.app into Applications.
open /Applications/logotomy.app     # Launch the GUI
```

### Windows

```bash
# Download logotomy-<version>-setup.exe and run the NSIS installer.
# It installs logotomy.exe (with app icon); launch from the Start Menu.
```

### Ubuntu / Linux

```bash
# .deb:  sudo apt install ./logotomy_<version>_amd64.deb
# or .AppImage:  chmod +x logotomy-<version>-x86_64.AppImage && ./logotomy-<version>-x86_64.AppImage
logotomy    # Launch the GUI
```

### From source (any platform)

Prereqs: a working [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs) (1.85+).

```bash
# Build and run the GUI (recommended for big files)
cargo run --release

# Just build the binary
cargo build --release
# → target/release/logotomy        (the GUI)
```

### MCP server mode (for AI assistants)

The same binary also runs the MCP server:

```bash
./logotomy --mcp                          # stdio mode (for AI assistants)
./logotomy --mcp --port 9876              # HTTP mode on port 9876
./logotomy --mcp --port 9876 --status-file /tmp/s   # HTTP + status file
```

Build MCP-only (Linux/Windows cross-compile):

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

### Open a file
- **Drag & drop** any text file (`.log`, `.txt`, `.out`, `.csv`, …) anywhere into the window, or
- click **📂 Open file**.
- A **progress bar** shows real indexing progress (two stages: *Indexing lines*, then *Mining templates & timestamps*). Cancel with × if you dropped the wrong file.
- Each file opens in its own **tab** — open as many as you like, close them with the × next to the tab name.

### Custom date recognizers
logotomy auto-detects the timestamp family (shown as `format: … · date: …` in the top bar). If your log uses a date shape it doesn't recognize, add your own:

1. Click **Custom date** (top bar, left of Settings).
2. Give the format a **Name**, paste a **Regex** that captures the timestamp using named groups — required `year, month, day, hour, min, sec`, optional `ms` (milliseconds) and `ampm` (for 12-hour `AM`/`PM`). Example for `2026-08-14 4:08:23.668 PM`:
   ```text
   (?P<year>\d{4})-(?P<month>\d{2})-(?P<day>\d{2}) (?P<hour>\d{1,2}):(?P<min>\d{2}):(?P<sec>\d{2})\.(?P<ms>\d{3}) (?P<ampm>[AP]M)
   ```
3. Paste a **sample log line** under it. The window live-verifies the regex and prints the parsed components (`Year: … Month: … Date: … Hour: … Min: … Sec: … MILLI SECOND: …`).
4. Click **Add custom date format** (enabled once the regex matches). It's saved to `~/.logotomy/custom_date_format_list.json` and tried together with the built-in families on the **next file you open**.
5. To apply to the file that's already open, use **Re-scan active log** in the same window (per-tab filters/pins/scroll reset on re-scan).

### The log view (center)
- Virtualized: a 5-million-line file scrolls as smoothly as a 50-line one.
- Gutter shows the **line number** and the line's **template ID** (`T12`).
- Click any line to select it (white selection bar on the timeline).
- **Right-click** any line for a context menu with **📌 Pin log** and **📝 Add analysis**.
- The right edge has a **black scroll-position indicator bar** showing where you are in the file.
- Log lines render in the embedded **Space Mono** monospace font (SIL OFL 1.1 — see the README thanks section); the **A− / A+** toolbar buttons change the size from 8 to 24 px.
- Filters you add (below) are **highlighted inline**, in the filter's color.
- **Search box** (right side of toolbar): type a string and press **Enter** to find all occurrences in the visible log lines. Amber highlights mark every match. Use **▲/▼** (or Up/Down arrows) to step through matches; **Left/Right** arrows step when the search box is not focused. Press **Esc** to clear the search, or **Esc** again to clear a keyword highlight.
- **Double-click any word** in a log line to highlight every occurrence of that word in cyan. The word is also pre-filled into the search box — press **Enter** to turn it into a full search. Single-click anywhere clears the keyword highlight.

### Filter bookmarks
- The add section is prominently framed with a heading "🔑 Add Filter".
- Type a filter in the text field and press **Enter** (e.g. `ERROR`, `timeout`, `user_id=42`) or click the **➕ Add** button.
- Up to **20 filters** are supported. The input is disabled once the cap is reached.
- Scanning happens in the background (spinner while chewing).

### The timeline
- The timeline is a **fixed-height panel** at the top — it always shows the full histogram, all filter lanes, axis labels, and the zoom/minimap strip, and can never be shrunk to hide lanes. Its height grows/shrinks with the number of filters.
- Shows the whole file as a full-height density histogram, with one **colored lane per filter**. Each lane has a **straight 1px line** in the filter's color across the full lane width, plus clickable ◆ diamonds for individual matches.
- **Left column** shows filter names (up to 14 chars) with **👁 eye markers** (👁 = lane enabled, bold label; 🚫 = disabled, normal weight label). Click to toggle. The first lane is "Everything Else" — it has the eye toggle but **cannot be removed**.
- **Hover a filter's name/eye** to see a tooltip with the **full filter text** and its **total match count**, e.g. `Some Filter (334 occurrences)`.
- Each filter lane has a **🗑 trash icon** on the right of its label. Clicking it always asks for confirmation before removing the filter — unless you tick **"Do not ask me again"** in the popup (or enable *Settings → Do not ask before deleting a filter*).
- **Bottom toolbar** (shown while filters exist, left-aligned):
  - **👁 Hide all filters / Show all filters** — toggles every filter lane at once; the **Everything Else** lane is never touched.
  - **🗑 Clear all filters** — removes every filter (behind a confirmation popup, following the same "do not ask again" preference).
- **Right column** has ↕ (zoom) and ↔ (pan) hint icons with hover tooltips.
- **Zoom** — scroll anywhere over the timeline. Zoom is continuous and works on both trackpads and mouse wheels.
- **Pan** — drag left/right (without shift). Snaps at the file boundaries.
- **Brush select** — shift+drag to draw a rectangle; on release, zooms to that range.
- **Reset zoom** — double-click anywhere on the timeline, or click the ↺ button.
- **Minimap** — click anywhere on the minimap to jump to that position.
- **Hover** the timeline for per-bucket details (time, line count, per-filter counts).
- **Click** the timeline → jumps to the nearest filter match (or approximate position).
  A white marker shows your current position.
- **Axis labels** are smart: if all ticks share the same hour, only `MM:SS.ms` is shown.
- **Inter-tick duration labels** (e.g. `Δ 3.3s`, `Δ 1m 34s`) appear between each pair of tick labels.

### Bottom panel (pinned lines + analyses)
- **Right-click** any log line → context menu:
  - **📌 Pin log** — saves the line to the bottom panel for quick revisiting.
  - **📝 Add analysis** — opens a text input to write a free-text note about that line.
- Expand/collapse the panel with the **▼/▶** header. When collapsed, shows counts.
- When empty, shows a brief hint: "Right-click a log line to pin it or add an analysis."
- Pinned lines show **line number + text snippet**; click the **✏️ edit** button to reopen the pin window and edit its comment/lines, or **×** to unpin.
- Analyses show **line number, snippet, and your note**; click **×** to delete.
- **"Clear all"** empties everything and collapses the panel.

### Templates panel (right, 🧩)
- logotomy runs the **Drain template-mining algorithm** natively in Rust while loading.
- The panel lists mined patterns sorted by frequency, e.g. `×12043 T3 GET /api/<*> status=<*>`.
- **Click a template** to jump to an example occurrence.
- Great first stop when you don't even know what's *in* a file.

### Timestamps
Auto-detected per file from a sample of the first lines. Supported families:

| Family | Example |
|---|---|
| ISO-8601 | `2026-07-19T10:15:30.123Z`, `2026-07-19 10:15:30,456`, `…+06:00` |
| Slashed | `2026/07/19 10:15:30` |
| US numeric | `08/20/2026 10:15:30.125`, `08-20-2026 10:15:30` |
| Day-first numeric | `20-08-2026 10:15:30`, `20.08.2026 10:15:30` |
| Year-first dotted | `2026.08.20 10:15:30` |
| Syslog | `Jan  5 03:22:11` (assumes current year) |
| Apache | `10/Oct/2024:13:55:36 +0000` |
| RFC 2822 | `Thu, 20 Aug 2026 10:15:30 +0000` |
| Epoch | `1784158530123` or `1784158530` |
| Logcat threadtime | `07-15 22:00:01.123` (yearless) |
| glog | `I0715 22:00:01.123456` (yearless) |

### Log format detection
logotomy first recognizes the **log format** from a sample, then applies a
format-aware normalization before template mining — structured formats get
field-aware templates instead of raw token fragmentation:

| Format | Recognized shape | Timestamp |
|---|---|---|
| JSON | `{"time": …, "lvl": …, "msg": …}` | from `time`/`timestamp` field |
| CEF | `CEF:0\|Vendor\|Product\|…` | none (timeless) |
| RFC 5424 | `<134>1 2026-…Z host app proc msgid - msg` | ISO |
| Apple ULS | `2026-…+0300 0x… Default 0x… 12345 …` (`log show`) | ISO |
| Logcat brief | `D/Tag: message` | none |
| iOS OSLog console | `[Subsystem:Category] LEVEL: message` | none |
| Plain (fallback) | anything else | auto-detected |

If no timestamps are found, the timeline falls back to **line numbers** and says so.
Untimestamped lines (stack traces etc.) inherit the previous line's timestamp.

## 3. The MCP server (AI-assistant bridge)

`logotomy --mcp` speaks MCP over **stdio** (newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0), so an
AI assistant can load logs, query them with filters, and pull exact log windows.

In the GUI you can also start an **in-process MCP server** from the top toolbar
("Start MCP", next to Settings). It binds a random OS-assigned port with a
per-session random 6-digit secret token in the URL (`http://127.0.0.1:PORT/SECRET`),
and "Copy MCP instruction" copies a ready-to-paste prompt for your coding agent. The prompt
explains that GUI mode already serves the selected tab, recommends starting with
`summarize_log`, and warns that the URL contains a temporary local secret. Stop MCP when you
are finished sharing the log.
GUI mode serves the active log and exposes the analysis tools (plus GUI-only
`trim`) without `load_log`/`list_logs`/`close_log`.

### Wire it into an MCP client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logotomy": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/logotomy",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `load_log` | `path` → indexes the file, returns `log_id` + stats (lines, time range, top templates) |
| `list_logs` | All loaded documents with stats |
| `close_log` | Unload a `log_id` and free memory |
| `find_occurrences` | Lines containing `keyword`, paginated (`offset`, `max_results`); returns total count + first/last-seen, optional `after`/`before` window; `format="refs"` for anchors-only, `context=N` for collapsed surroundings |
| `summarize_log` | One-call orientation (optional `start`/`end` range): stats, top/error-ish templates, biggest time gaps, densest minute, plus byte-size budget estimates |
| `get_timeline_histogram` | Tiny `{x, counts}` distribution for whole log / keyword / template, optional range — find the spike first |
| `get_template_anomalies` | Rare, first-seen-late, and bursty templates ("what's unusual here"), optional range |
| `get_template` | Resolve template ids to `{pattern, count, example_line}`; omit `ids` for all |
| `get_template_samples` | A few concrete example lines for a template |
| `log_sequence` | Dense `[[epoch_ms\|null, line, template_id], …]` over a line/time range; optional `collapse`, returns `truncated` when capped |
| `raw_log` | Raw lines over a line/time range (`start`, `end`), `max_lines` + `truncated` flag |
| `trim` | (GUI mode) focus the open log's visible window to a line/time range |

Time arguments accept `RFC3339` (`2026-07-19T10:15:30Z`), `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`,
`YYYY-MM-DD`, or epoch millis/seconds. `start`/`end` range bounds accept either a
1-based line number (integer) or a time (string).

### Example conversation flow

```
load_log(path="/var/log/app.log")                → log_1 (2.1M lines, 10:00→12:00)
summarize_log(log_1)                            → {stats, top/error templates, gaps, template_size_bytes, …}
get_timeline_histogram(log_1)                   → spike around 10:31
log_sequence(log_1, start="10:31:00", end="10:31:30")  → dense [time, line, template_id] triples
get_template(log_1, ids=[7, 12])                 → what those template ids mean
raw_log(log_1, start="10:31:05", end="10:31:08") → the exact lines
```

### Quick manual smoke test

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
 '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"cli","version":"0"}}}' \
 '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"load_log","arguments":{"path":"/tmp/app.log"}}}' \
 | ./logotomy --mcp
```

## 4. Performance & limits

- **Memory-mapped I/O** — the file is never fully materialized; the OS pages it lazily.
- **SIMD line indexing** (`memchr`) — GB/s territory for the offset index.
- **Single analysis pass** — format detection + timestamps + Drain templates in one sweep.
- **Aho-Corasick** — all filters matched in one scan pass; 12 filters cost ≈ 1.
- Measured on an M-series MacBook with a 64MB / 787k-line synthetic log:
  full load (index + timestamps + Drain mining) **≈ 3.3s** with a live progress
  bar, 3-filter whole-file scan **≈ 0.7s**, timeline build **≈ 13ms**.
  Run `cargo run --release --example bench` to check your machine.
- Per-line render length is capped at 2000 chars in the GUI (data stays intact in the mmap).
- Tested edge cases: CRLF endings, missing trailing newline, blank lines,
  multi-MB single lines, invalid UTF-8 (lossy display), files with no timestamps.
